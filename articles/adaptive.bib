  abstract = {The potential important role of the prior distribution of the roughness penalty parameter in the resulting smoothness of Bayesian P-splines models is considered. The recommended specification for that distribution yields models that can lack flexibility in specific circumstances. In such instances, these are shown to correspond to a frequentist P-splines model with a predefined and severe roughness penalty parameter, an obviously undesirable feature. It is shown that the specification of a hyperprior distribution for one parameter of that prior distribution provides the desired flexibility. Alternatively, a mixture prior can also be used. An extension of these two models by enabling adaptive penalties is provided. The posterior of all the proposed models can be quickly explored using the convenient Gibbs sampler.},

  abstract = {The paper studies spline fitting with a roughness penalty that adapts to spatial heterogeneity in the regression function. The estimates are pth degree piecewise polynomials with p- 1 continuous derivatives. A large and fixed number of knots is used and smoothing is achieved by putting a quadratic penalty on the jumps of the pth derivative at the knots. To be spatially adaptive, the logarithm of the penalty is itself a linear spline but with relatively few knots and with values at the knots chosen to minimize the generalized cross validation (GCV) criterion. This locally-adaptive spline estimator is compared with other spline estimators in the literature such as cubic smoothing splines and knot-selection techniques for least squares regression. Our estimator can be interpreted as an empirical Bayes estimate for a prior allowing spatial heterogeneity. In cases of spatially heterogeneous regression functions, empirical Bayes confidence intervals using this prior achieve better pointwise coverage probabilities than confidence intervals based on a global-penalty parameter. The method is developed first for univariate models and then extended to additive models.},

  abstract = {The P-splines of Eilers and Marx (1996) combine a B-spline basis with a discrete quadratic penalty on the basis coefficients, to produce a reduced rank spline like smoother. P-splines have three properties that make them very popular as reduced rank smoothers: i) the basis and the penalty are sparse, enabling efficient computation, especially for Bayesian stochastic simulation; ii) it is possible to flexibly `mix-and-match' the order of B-spline basis and penalty, rather than the order of penalty controlling the order of the basis as in spline smoothing; iii) it is very easy to set up the Bspline basis functions and penalties. The discrete penalties are somewhat less interpretable in terms of function shape than the traditional derivative based spline penalties, but tend towards penalties proportional to traditional spline penalties in the limit of large basis size. However part of the point of P-splines is not to use a large basis size. In addition the spline basis functions arise from solving functional optimization problems involving derivative based penalties, so moving to discrete penalties for smoothing may not always be desirable. The purpose of this note is to point out that the three properties of basis-penalty sparsity, mix-and-match penalization and ease of setup are readily obtainable with B-splines subject to derivative based penalization. The penalty setup typically requires a few lines of code, rather than the two lines typically required for P-splines, but this one off disadvantage seems to be the only one associated with using derivative based penalties. As an example application, it is shown how basis-penalty sparsity enables efficient computation with tensor product smoothers of scattered data.},

  abstract = {The smoothing spline is one of the most popular curve-fitting methods, partly because of empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness and partly because of its elegant mathematical formulation. However, there are two obstacles that restrict the use of the smoothing spline in practical statistical work. Firstly, it becomes computationally prohibitive for large data sets because the number of basis functions roughly equals the sample size. Secondly, its global smoothing parameter can only provide a constant amount of smoothing, which often results in poor performances when estimating inhomogeneous functions. In this work, we introduce a class of adaptive smoothing spline models that is derived by solving certain stochastic differential equations with finite element methods. The solution extends the smoothing parameter to a continuous data-driven function, which is able to capture the change of the smoothness of the underlying process. The new model is Markovian, which makes Bayesian computation fast. A simulation study and real data example are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},
