  abstract = {While log-Gaussian Cox process regression models are useful u tools for modeling point patterns, they can be technically difficult n to fit and require users to learn/adopt bespoke software. We show that, for suitably formatted data, we can actually fit these models a using generalized additive model software, via a simple line of code, demonstrated on R by the popular mgcv package. We are able M to do this because a common and computationally efficient way to fit a log-Gaussian Cox process model is to use a basis function d expansion to approximate the Gaussian random field, as is te provided by a generic bivariate smoother over geographic space. We further show that if basis functions are parameterized appropriately then we can estimate parameters in the spatial p covariance function for the latent random field using a generalized e additive model. We use simulation to show that this approach c leads to model fits of comparable quality to state-of-the-art software, often more quickly. But we see the main advance from c this work as lowering the technology barrier to spatial statistics A for applied researchers, many of whom are already familiar with generalized additive model software.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a technique for computing approximate maximum pseudolikelihood estimates of the parameters of a spatial point process. The method is an extension of Berman \& Turner's (1992) device for maximizing the likelihoods of inhomogeneous spatial Poisson processes. For a very wide class of spatial point process models the likelihood is intractable, while the pseudolikelihood is known explicitly, except for the computation of an integral over the sampling region. Approximation of this integral by a finite sum in a special way yields an approximate pseudolikelihood which is formally equivalent to the (weighted) likelihood of a loglinear model with Poisson responses. This can be maximized using standard statistical software for generalized linear or additive models, provided the conditional intensity of the process takes an `exponential family' form. Using this approach a wide variety of spatial point process models of Gibbs type can be fitted rapidly, incorporating spatial trends, interaction between points, dependence on spatial covariates, and mark information.},

  abstract = {We use spatial point pattern methods to analyse gorilla nest site data, and to enhance our understanding of the nesting behaviour of the Gorilla gorilla diehli in the Kagwene Sanctuary, Cameroon. Data were split into different seasons and different gorilla groups to better understand gorilla nesting behaviour at these different scales. Gorilla nest site distribution was found to be inhomogeneous and clustered, as a result of the inhomogeneity in the distribution of the environmental factors (such as elevation, slope, vegetation and aspect), and because of the interaction between nest sites. The proposed models reflected therefore a combination of the effect of environmental factors and interaction between nest sites. Predictions from these models showed that there is less space available for gorilla nest site location in the dry season than in the rainy season. It also showed that the Minor gorilla group has a bigger niche than the Major group, suggesting a nesting disadvantage in the larger size group. We also found that nest site locations of Major gorilla groups attract Minor groups, and vice versa.},
