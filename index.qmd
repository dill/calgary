# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a book about the kinds of things you can do in `mgcv` that you might not have realised that you can do in `mgcv`.

Here are some possible topics:

- Poisson process fitting
- cross-validation
- stochastic partial differential equation smoothing
- capture-recapture (I think?)
- being a secret Bayesian *and* being a more obvious Bayesian

with bonus material on:

- how to do things not in `mgcv` (how to import `mgcv` smoothers into other models/frameworks/software)
